Domain Name Service (DNS) is a fundamental part of Internet. 
DNS server stores host addresses of a domain name, as well 
as other kinds of informations. DNS resolver communicates 
with DNS server to retrieve various informations associated 
with a domain.

A DNS resolver is designed and implemented with Object-Oriented 
paradigm. The request and response message of DNS protocol are 
wrapped as Packet object. Resolver send a request message to 
DNS server and the result is returned within a response message. 
Current implementation only parses the resource records with 
types of A, CNAME, and TXT, although other types of resource 
records are also returned within response message.
