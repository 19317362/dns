DNS Resolver

This is part of my hands-on work for my course at The George Washington 
University. A DNS resolver is designed and implemented with Object-Oriented 
paradigm. The request and response message of DNS protocol are wrapped as 
Packet object. Resolver send a request message to DNS server and the result 
is returned within a response message. Current implementation only parses 
the resource records with types of A, CNAME, and TXT, although other types 
of resource records are also returned within response message.
